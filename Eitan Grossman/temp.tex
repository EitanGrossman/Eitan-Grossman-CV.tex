%tns: First off, you're using biber here, not bibtex, which is an added level of difficulty... but not insurmountable
%tns: Second, note the filename in line 8 that you're calling: "myibliography.bib"
%tns:       Compare that filename to the name of the only .bib file in this project: "Bibliography.bib"
%tns:       They don't match, so of course it's looking for a file that doesn't exist
%tns: Third, you don't actually have a command in here to print a bibliography (usually at the end of a file): you need \printbibliography if you're using biber
%tns: Fourth, why do you have a bibliography in a CV? (lists of publications are usually different from bibliographies, no? though it's an interesting idea...)

%EG - OH hey, this is just a scratch file, take a look at Eitan Grossman CV, I thought that that was what I was sharing with you...
%EG - Can you see that?


\title{Eitan Grossman CV}
\author{eitan.grossman }
%tns: Are you going with a new artistic name format thing, e.e. cummings-style?

%tns: Note that hitting 'tab' isn't going to insert spaces in a .tex file. If you want to just manually add space on the same line, you want \hspace (the h is for horizontal). Or you might consider making this whole thing a table, so the columns align...
    \item Country of Birth	    USA
